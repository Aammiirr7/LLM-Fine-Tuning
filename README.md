# LLM Fine Tuning
Fine-Tuning a Language Model for Revenue Analysis from Structured Data : 

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning an open-source Language Model (LLM) from Huggingface to interact with structured financial data. The goal is to create a chatbot capable of answering specific questions related to revenue data from a given dataset. This involves using embeddings and fine-tuning techniques to enhance the model's performance on the provided dataset.

Features:

1) Model Selection: 
    1a) Use an open-source LLM from Huggingface, such as GPT-2 or BERT.
    1b) Leverage pre-trained models for natural language understanding and generation.

2) Data Preparation:
    2a) Load and preprocess the sample data file, which includes revenue information from various regions and product categories.
    2b) Ensure data is in a structured format suitable for training and querying.

3) Fine-Tuning:

    3a) Fine-tune the selected LLM on the specific task of revenue analysis using the provided sample data.
    3b) Use CUDA for accelerated training, improving the efficiency and performance of the fine-tuning process.

4) Embeddings and Query Handling:

    4a) Utilize embeddings to represent data in a way that the model can understand and process.
    4b) Implement mechanisms to handle queries about specific revenue details, such as revenues by region, product category, and time period.
